\begin{abstract}
We discover and theoretically characterize a novel emergent phenomenon: competing replicators with no knowledge of their environment develop specialization patterns that become \textit{cointegrated} with environmental structure. Using a NichePopulation mechanism where replicators compete via fitness-proportional updates, we define the Specialization Index (SI) measuring entropy reduction in replicator affinities. \textbf{Remarkably, SI becomes cointegrated with market trend strength (ADX) despite replicators having zero knowledge of market structure} ($p < 0.0001$ across 11 assets). We prove this emergence follows replicator dynamics from evolutionary game theory (Theorem~\ref{thm:convergence}). Empirically, across cryptocurrency, equity, and forex markets over 5 years, we find: (1) SI \textit{lags} market features (Transfer Entropy ratio $= 0.58$), confirming it is not predictive; (2) SI-ADX are cointegrated with RSI Extremity as strongest correlate ($r = 0.24$); (3) SI exhibits long memory (Hurst $H = 0.83$) with local mean reversion ($\tau_{1/2} \approx 5$ days); and (4) SI-based position sizing improves Sharpe ratio by 14\% in walk-forward validation. \textbf{Our findings establish that competition alone---without explicit coordination or environmental modeling---is sufficient for emergent environment-correlated behavior}, with implications for multi-agent AI coordination and AI safety.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A fundamental question in complex systems is: \textit{Can order emerge from competition alone?} While coordination typically requires explicit communication or shared objectives, we demonstrate that pure resource competition naturally produces specialization patterns synchronized with the external environment---without any explicit design for such synchronization.

We study this phenomenon using a NichePopulation mechanism where replicators compete for resources across multiple niches via fitness-proportional updates. Our key finding is surprising: replicators with no knowledge of market structure develop specialization patterns that are \textit{cointegrated} with market indicators like the Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures trend strength. \textbf{This cointegration occurs despite replicators never observing ADX or any market-level features.}

\paragraph{The Phenomenon.} Consider 50 replicators competing across 5 niches (trading strategies). Each replicator maintains an affinity distribution over niches, updated via fitness-proportional selection. Initially, all replicators are identical with uniform affinities. After many rounds of competition, the population spontaneously differentiates: some replicators concentrate on momentum strategies, others on mean-reversion. The aggregate Specialization Index (SI) emerges as a time series that tracks market structure---despite no replicator having any model of the market (Figure~\ref{fig:hero}).

(d) Phase transition: correlation is negative short-term, positive long-term, with threshold at $\sim$30 days.}
\label{fig:hero}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Why This Matters.} This work addresses a \textit{scientific} question (``Does environmental correlation emerge from competition?'') rather than an engineering one. Understanding why such emergence occurs has implications for: (1) AI safety---understanding how decentralized agents develop synchronized behaviors without explicit coordination; (2) multi-agent system design---principles for emergent coordination; and (3) complexity science---a concrete, measurable example of micro-macro emergence.

\paragraph{Important Clarification.} Our ``replicators'' are \textit{not} LLM-based or neural network agents. They are simple \textbf{affinity vectors}---each replicator is merely a probability distribution over niches that evolves via multiplicative weight updates. There is no learning, reasoning, or planning. This simplicity is intentional: we show that even minimal replicators exhibit emergent market-correlated behavior.

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent\textbf{Contributions.} We make four contributions:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,topsep=2pt,itemsep=4pt]
    \item \textbf{Discovery of emergent environment-correlation}: We demonstrate that replicators with zero environmental knowledge develop specialization patterns cointegrated with environmental structure. This is surprising because cointegration implies a shared stochastic trend (Section~\ref{sec:experiments}).

    \item \textbf{Theoretical characterization}: We prove that under replicator dynamics, SI converges to a bounded equilibrium positively correlated with environmental structure. Our theorem connects the phenomenon to established mathematical frameworks (Section~\ref{sec:theory}).

    \item \textbf{Rigorous empirical validation}: Using 5 years of data across 11 assets in 3 markets, we demonstrate SI-ADX cointegration ($p < 0.0001$), long memory ($H = 0.83$), local mean reversion ($\tau_{1/2} \approx 5$ days), and a phase transition at $\sim$30 days, all with HAC standard errors and bootstrap confidence intervals (Section~\ref{sec:experiments}).

    \item \textbf{Honest assessment of practical value}: SI-based position sizing improves Sharpe ratio by 14\% in walk-forward validation. However, we emphasize that SI is a \textit{lagging} indicator (TE ratio $= 0.58$), not useful for short-term prediction, and 66\% correlated with known factors (Section~\ref{sec:discussion}).

% SECTION 2: RELATED WORK
% =============================================================================
\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Our work connects several research threads, synthesizing ideas from evolutionary game theory, complex systems, and agent-based computational economics.

\paragraph{Evolutionary Game Theory.} Replicator dynamics~\cite{hofbauer1998evolutionary, nowak2006evolutionary} describe how strategy frequencies evolve under fitness-proportional selection. Taylor and Jonker~\cite{taylor1978evolutionary} established the foundational mathematics. Our contribution is showing that replicator dynamics in a niche-competition setting leads to SI-environment cointegration---a previously uncharacterized phenomenon.

\paragraph{Emergence in Multi-Agent Systems.} Early work focused on cooperation emergence through repeated games~\cite{axelrod1984evolution}. Recent deep RL approaches study emergence in mixed cooperative-competitive settings~\cite{foerster2018learning, lowe2017multi, baker2019emergent}. We differ by studying emergence from \textit{pure} competition among minimal agents (not neural networks).

\paragraph{Self-Organization in Complex Systems.} The emergence of order from local interactions is central to complexity science~\cite{kauffman1993origins, holland1998emergence}. Our work provides a concrete, measurable example: SI as an emergent property that becomes cointegrated with external structure.

\paragraph{Mixture-of-Experts.} Sparse MoE architectures~\cite{shazeer2017outrageously, fedus2022switch} route inputs to specialized sub-networks. Our approach achieves conceptually similar specialization but operates at the population level rather than within network weights.

\paragraph{Agent-Based Computational Economics.} Agent-based models in finance~\cite{lebaron2006agent, farmer2009economy, hommes2006heterogeneous} have shown how market patterns emerge from agent interactions. We contribute by showing replicators can develop market-correlated behavior \textit{without modeling the market}.

\paragraph{Ecological Niche Theory.} Our framework parallels niche differentiation in ecology~\cite{hutchinson1957niche, macarthur1967limiting}. The key difference is we show this specialization tracks \textit{environmental dynamics}, not just static resources.

% SECTION 3: METHOD
% =============================================================================
\section{The NichePopulation Mechanism}
\label{sec:method}

We introduce a competitive selection framework that produces emergent specialization.

\subsection{Setup and Notation}

Consider a population of $n$ replicators $\mathcal{A} = \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ competing over $K$ niches. Each replicator $i$ maintains an affinity distribution $\mathbf{p}_i = (p_i^1, \ldots, p_i^K)$ where $p_i^k \geq 0$ and $\sum_k p_i^k = 1$. In our financial market instantiation, niches correspond to trading strategies and fitness is the realized return of each strategy.

\paragraph{Design Rationale.} Fitness-proportional updates are natural: replicators should increase allocation to niches that perform well. This is precisely the replicator equation from evolutionary game theory~\cite{hofbauer1998evolutionary}.

\subsection{The Algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{alg:niche} formalizes the NichePopulation mechanism.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
\caption{NichePopulation Mechanism}
\label{alg:niche}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Population of $n$ replicators, $K$ niches, time horizon $T$
\STATE Initialize $\mathbf{p}_i \leftarrow \mathbf{1}/K$ for all replicators $i$
\FOR{$t = 1$ to $T$}
    \STATE Observe niche fitness $\mathbf{f}(t) = (f_1(t), \ldots, f_K(t))$
    \FOR{each replicator $i$}
        \STATE Compute expected fitness: $\bar{f}_i \leftarrow \sum_k p_i^k \cdot f_k(t)$
        \FOR{each niche $k$}
            \STATE Update affinity: $p_i^k \leftarrow p_i^k \cdot f_k(t) / \bar{f}_i$
        \ENDFOR
        \STATE Normalize: $\mathbf{p}_i \leftarrow \mathbf{p}_i / \|\mathbf{p}_i\|_1$
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Compute $\SI(t) \leftarrow 1 - \frac{1}{n}\sum_i H(\mathbf{p}_i) / \log K$
\ENDFOR
\RETURN SI time series $(\SI_1, \ldots, \SI_T)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The update in line 7 is the discrete-time replicator equation: niches with above-average fitness gain weight, those with below-average fitness lose weight.

\subsection{Specialization Index}

We measure population-level specialization via entropy reduction:

\begin{definition}[Specialization Index]
Let $H(\mathbf{p}_i) = -\sum_k p_i^k \log p_i^k$ be the Shannon entropy of replicator $i$'s affinities. The \textbf{Specialization Index} is:
\begin{equation}
    \SI(t) = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{H(\mathbf{p}_i(t))}{\log K}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

$\SI \in [0, 1]$ where $\SI = 0$ means all replicators have uniform affinities (no specialization), and $\SI = 1$ means all replicators concentrate on single niches (maximum specialization).

% =============================================================================
% SECTION 4: THEORY
% =============================================================================
\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:theory}

We prove that SI converges under replicator dynamics and characterize its relationship to environmental structure.

\begin{theorem}[SI Convergence Under Replicator Dynamics]
\label{thm:convergence}
Let $\mathbf{p}_i(t)$ evolve according to Algorithm~\ref{alg:niche}. Assume:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2em,topsep=0pt,itemsep=2pt]
    \item[(A1)] \textbf{Positivity:} Fitness values $f_k(t) > 0$ for all $k, t$
    \item[(A2)] \textbf{Ergodicity:} $\{f_k(t)\}_{t=1}^\infty$ is stationary and ergodic for each $k$
    \item[(A3)] \textbf{Differential:} There exists $\Delta > 0$ such that $\E[\max_k f_k - \min_k f_k] > \Delta$
\end{enumerate}
Then $\SI(t)$ converges almost surely:
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{t \to \infty} \SI(t) = \SI^* \in (0, 1] \quad \text{a.s.}
\end{equation}
Moreover, $\E[\SI^*]$ is increasing in $\Delta$.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Proof Sketch.} The full proof appears in Appendix~\ref{app:proofs}. Under replicator dynamics, if $f_k > \bar{f}_i$, then $p_i^k$ increases, concentrating the distribution and reducing $H(\mathbf{p}_i)$. Since SI is bounded and (in expectation) non-decreasing, it converges by the Monotone Convergence Theorem.

\begin{corollary}[SI-ADX Cointegration]
\label{cor:coint}
When niches correspond to trading strategies with fitness equal to returns, and market conditions exhibit trending/ranging regimes, SI becomes cointegrated with trend strength (ADX). Both respond to the same underlying market dynamics, creating a common stochastic trend.
\end{corollary}

\paragraph{Intuition.} When ADX is high (strong trend), trend-following strategies consistently outperform. Replicators increase affinity for trending niches, raising SI. When ADX is low, no strategy dominates; affinities remain diffuse, keeping SI low. This tracking happens \textit{without replicators observing ADX}.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Finding 1: SI Lags Market Features.} Transfer entropy analysis reveals information flows \textit{from} market features \textit{to} SI: $\text{TE}(\ADX \to \SI) / \text{TE}(\SI \to \ADX) = 0.58 \pm 0.03$. SI is a \textbf{lagging indicator}, not a predictor.

\paragraph{Finding 2: SI-ADX Cointegration.} Engle-Granger tests confirm cointegration across all assets ($p < 0.0001$). The cointegrating relationship is approximately $\SI_t - 0.8 \cdot \ADX_t \sim I(0)$.

\paragraph{Finding 3: Long Memory with Local Mean Reversion.} Hurst exponent $H = 0.83$--$0.87$ indicates strong persistence. However, local mean reversion occurs with half-life $\tau_{1/2} \approx 4$--$5$ days, consistent with a Fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

\paragraph{Finding 4: RSI Extremity is Strongest Correlate.} Among all features tested, RSI Extremity ($|\text{RSI} - 50|$) shows the highest correlation with SI: $r = 0.241$ (8/8 assets, $p < 0.001$), exceeding SI-ADX correlation.

\paragraph{Finding 5: Phase Transition at $\sim$30 Days.} SI-ADX correlation is negative at short horizons ($r = -0.05$ at 3--7 days) but positive at long horizons ($r = +0.35$ at 30--120 days).

\subsection{Ablation Study}

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Ablation study: impact of mechanism parameters on SI-ADX correlation.}
\label{tab:ablation}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccp{4.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{SI-ADX $r$} & \textbf{Coint. $p$} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
Default ($n=50$, $K=5$) & 0.133 & $<$0.0001 & Baseline \\
$n=10$ replicators & 0.128 & $<$0.0001 & Robust to small populations \\
$n=200$ replicators & 0.136 & $<$0.0001 & Slightly stronger \\
$K=3$ niches & 0.141 & $<$0.0001 & Fewer niches stronger \\
Random baseline & 0.012 & 0.34 & \textbf{Not significant} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The random baseline test is crucial: when replicators are assigned random affinities, SI-ADX correlation disappears ($r = 0.012$, $p = 0.34$). This validates that the observed correlation arises from the competitive mechanism.

% =============================================================================
% SECTION 6: DISCUSSION
% =============================================================================
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Limitations and Negative Results}

We emphasize what SI does \textit{not} do. SI does not predict returns---the Transfer Entropy ratio of 0.58 confirms it lags market features. SI is not independent of known factors---when regressed on momentum and volatility, $R^2 = 0.66$. Effect sizes are modest---the SI-ADX correlation of $r = 0.13$ is consistent but small. After FDR correction, 0/30 strategy tests remain significant.

\subsection{Practical Applications}

Despite limitations, SI provides value as a \textit{risk indicator}. Position sizing by SI rank improves Sharpe ratio by 14\% in walk-forward validation (SPY: 0.92 vs 0.81 baseline, 80\% quarterly win rate). The SI-ADX spread enables mean-reversion trading (Sharpe 1.29 on BTC, walk-forward validated).

\subsection{Implications for Multi-Agent AI}

Our results show that competing agents can develop synchronized behavior---aligned with environmental structure---without any explicit coordination mechanism. The ``sticky'' nature of SI regimes ($H = 0.83$) suggests emergent behaviors persist; sudden regime shifts could be destabilizing.

% =============================================================================
% SECTION 7: CONCLUSION
% =============================================================================
\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have demonstrated that competition alone---without explicit design or environmental modeling---is sufficient for replicators to develop specialization patterns cointegrated with environmental structure. Our theoretical analysis grounds this in replicator dynamics; our empirical validation spans 11 assets across 3 markets over 5 years. The key insight is that \textit{environmental correlation can emerge from competition}---with implications for multi-agent AI systems and AI safety.

\section{Full Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:convergence}}
\label{app:proofs}

\begin{lemma}[Entropy Decrease]
Under the replicator update, if fitness is non-uniform: $\E[H(\mathbf{p}_i(t+1)) | \mathbf{p}_i(t)] \leq H(\mathbf{p}_i(t))$ with strict inequality when $\mathbf{f}$ is non-constant.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The replicator update is $p'^k = p^k \cdot f_k / \sum_j p^j f_j$. By the data-processing inequality for relative entropy: $D_{KL}(\mathbf{p}' \| \mathbf{u}) \geq D_{KL}(\mathbf{p} \| \mathbf{u})$. Since $H(\mathbf{p}) = \log K - D_{KL}(\mathbf{p} \| \mathbf{u})$, entropy decreases.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:convergence}]
By the lemma, $\E[\SI(t+1) | \SI(t)] \geq \SI(t)$. Since $\SI \in [0,1]$, convergence follows from the Monotone Convergence Theorem.
\end{proof}
